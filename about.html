            <h3>My Favorite Video Games</h3>
            <p>I play a lot of video games. Video games are that safe space where you can either become lost in a good story, or get really competitive with friends. I love video games so much I decided to make that what I do for a living. When I have free time, I love playing games from a select genre: MMO FPS games or racing games. Here is a list of some of my favorite games at the moment.</p>
            <ul id="video-games-list">
                <li>Rocket League</li>
                <li>Hell Let Loose</li>
                <li>Battlefield V</li>
                <li>Need For Speed: Heat</li>
                <li>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II</li>
                <li>Battlefield 2042</li>
                <li>Splitgate</li>
                <li>Brawlhalla</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Out of all these great games, Rocket League is my #1 time consumer, and it's not even close. Essentially Rocket league is car soccer, on a closed in field, but the cars have boost- meaning cars can fly. I have been playing the game on and off since 2015, but more heavily these past 3 years. My current rank for both 2s and 3s is Champion 2(I hardly ever play 1s). Rocket League is just a game I can play for hours on end, always trying to get better while hitting insane shots from time to time.</p>

            <h3>But Wait, Theres More!</h3>
            <p>One cool fact about my life is that I am the youngest kid in a family of 4 children. Growing up in a family with 6 people was always a movie- people going everywhere all the time. There was never a dull moment in the house. I think being the youngest in the family has its perks because I can see some of the choices my siblings make a few years before I have to make them, and I can see how to and how not to do things. One downside of being the youngest is that I am the only one in college still. Everyone else has "moved on" in life, while I still feel like I am waiting to get into my career. It's crazy now because everyone has moved away from home: North Carolina and Illinois. At least now it's my turn to get spoiled by my parents. </p>
