            <h3>Campus Village Needs to Invoke More Action Toward Fixing My Apartment Internet</h3>
            <img src="CampusVillageImage1.jpg" alt="Image of Campus Village property">
            <p>It all started on Tuesday, 10/11. My roommates and I were on the couch, chillin on our phones. Then, all at once, our phones stop loading anything at all. After assessing the situation, we wait an hour to see if it would be fixed without us needing to intervene. Later in the evening we call the Campus Village office to get more information, or report the problem if they didn't already know.<p>
            <p>Turns out they did know about the problem. What they told me I was very confused by: 'we cant fix the internet yet until we have our higher ups take a look and do their own assessment.'</p> 
            <p>This made me a bit disappointed at the time, but little did I know I really needed internet for the week to download intensive Unity software. Internet speeds got really bad- only 25 kilobits per second, which I thought I was paying for close to gigabit internet. </p>
            <p>An email from Campus Village arrived in my inbox on Friday. The email noted that the earliest a technician can start assessing is Monday. Currently the internet is not even capable of loading any streaming platform home page. The future of our internet looks bright, though wounded currently. </p>

            <h3>Yesterday's Football Game Against Wisconsin Was The Best Football Game I've Attended</h3>
            <img src="MSUFBallGameImage.jpg" alt="Image of a full Spartan Stadium at the Michigan State vs Wisconsin football game">
            <p>Michigan State football came into this game with 3 straight losses up against Wisconsin who also had 3 straight losses. The predictions were that the game would be close. Wow it was a close game. Went into 2OT, where Mallory recovered a fumble, giving way for Thorne to throw a dime to Reed in the endzone to win it. For this game I was with My roommate, friend from elementary school, and a mutual friend from high school. All 3 of them had never been to a game at Spartan Stadium, and they couldn't have picked a better game to attend.</p>
            <p>When I was in high school, on Friday nights instead of going to the football games, I would be at work. I worked in a one room theatre every Friday night, so I never really got to experience any really great games. Freshman year at MSU was fun to attend the games, but the scores were never close, and fans always left at or before half in most cases, myself included. This game was different. Everyone stayed and brought the energy until the game winning play. It was electric, and something I'll never forget. </p>
